## About
Originally given a static webpage and transformed it into a mobile-ready web application.

Converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.
A service worker was added to help create an offline experience for users.

My task was to update the code to resolve these issues and features(above) while still maintaining the included functionality.

1. Download the zip file.

2. Extract it into a folder

3. Run 'python -m http.server 8000' in bash.
